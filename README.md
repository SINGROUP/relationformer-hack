# Relationformer: A Unified Framework for Image-to-Graph Generation

In this project, we've applied an image-to-graph translation tool ([Relationformer](https://github.com/suprosanna/relationformer)) for nc-AFM images to predict the sample structure including atomic types and bonds. In particular, we will use a transformer based model that simultaneously predicts objects (atoms) and their relations (bonds) for accurate geometry characterization. For gathering training data, we will use a high-throughput nc-AFM simulator (PPAFM) which gives us the high-resolution images and molecule-graph labels.
