## Introduction

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) plays a crucial role in characterizing atomic-scale nanostructures. However, identifying structures from AFM images is a challenging task that relies heavily on human expertise. Simulations, particularly with Particle Probe AFM (PPAFM) [1], offer a cost-effective solution for generating large volumes of AFM images. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models and extensive PPAFM-generated datasets, properties such as molecular structures, electrostatic potential maps, and molecular graphs can be accurately predicted using AFM images obtained from simulations or experiments.

## Motivation

Determining structures from AFM images is complex and demands significant human experience. By utilizing advanced AFM simulations and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we can generate numerous AFM images along with their corresponding structures. This dataset enables us to train machine learning models to map AFM images to their underlying structures.

In our previous works [2,3,4], we developed machine learning workflows based on a two-stage process. To enhance this workflow, we aim to use an end-to-end model, which simplifies the training process and improves overall efficiency. Such a model has great potential for application to experimental AFM images, enabling faster and more reliable structure discovery.

## What we've done

In this project, we successfully applied an image-to-graph translation tool, [Relationformer](https://github.com/suprosanna/relationformer) [5], to non-contact AFM (nc-AFM) images to predict sample structures, including atomic types and bonds. Specifically, we used a transformer-based model capable of simultaneously predicting objects (atoms) and their relationships (bonds), ensuring accurate geometric characterization.

To train this model, we utilized a high-throughput nc-AFM simulator, PPAFM, which provides high-resolution AFM images alongside molecular graph labels.

## Methods

- Simulation data: We have use PPM model to get the simulated images. 
- Image-to-Graph model: We have use the Relationformer as our end-to-end model. 

## Expected results

- Accurate prediction of molecular graphs, including atom types and bond information, from AFM images.
- Enhanced workflow efficiency by transitioning to an end-to-end machine learning model.
- Potential applicability to experimental AFM images for real-world structure discovery.
